# LinkFetch!
Yes, you heard that right! **LinkFetch!** Have you ever been faced by the need of saving all your currently open tabs in your browser?

**LinkFetch** is your solution! These are some of the cases I thought about when developing it:
- you finished some research and want to save all the links from your currently open tabs in case you later on want to take a look at them or quickly share them.
- you have trouble copying and pasting the links for later use (who doesn't find it hard to select a link, after all?)
